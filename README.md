# CS305_Mod5 #
In my CS386 class, my group and I have created CodeHub. <br>

CodeHub is a free, self-paced programming education web application designed to teach coding to all ages at any level of coding experience. In paticular, this application seeks to give users in depth projects to work on and the chance to work in small teams with other people. When completed users should be able to work through several different courses in computer programming (ideally new courses and languages will be added over time). There will be a course documenting the most basic elements of computer usage as well. Users will be able to track their progress, set reminders, and turn to a community forums page for help.
